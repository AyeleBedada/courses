</p>

<p>
Autodesk was founded by Mike Riddle, John Walker and other fellow programmers during the early 1980s. <br> 
Mike Riddle while developing his graphic software Interact worked at Frank Lloyd's Foundation and had 
observed the designers and planners working in the foundation. <br> 
There he had found an opportunity to test and develop his software among architects and designers 
of the foundation. <br> This latter led to his collaboration with his fellow programmer John Walker to 
conceive AutoCAD as a CAD software. <br>
In latter developments of the company ,Autodesk, John Walker was observed to have claimed having 
the a good understanding of the CAD industry. <br> This is important as professionals should be well versed 
how the characteristics of the ambitions of the  leaders of the CAD industry and the built industry would 
shape the practice of the built environment discipline.  
               
</p>
<p>
Malcolm McCullough  as a student of architecture in 1983 made a drawing of the Golden Gate Bridge that got 
international attention at the time adding to the positive impression of Autodesk in the CAD industry.   <br>            
The above points are relevant to our discussion because the importance of the built environment professionals, 
researchers and students is unequivocal. <br>
Such is still the case in the current period of the CAD industry professionals, researchers and students contributing, 
criticizing and using the CAD software. <br>
In the latter developments of its growth, Autodesk has also contributed to industries other than the built environment 
such as entertainment, scientific simulations and molecular studies.

<p>
Autodesk through its visionary founding member John Walker’s early exceptional understanding of the importance 
and potential of personal computers in the CAD industry came to be a leading CAD software provider. 
Furthermore the company entertained the contributions of third party developers through functionalities of the 
AutoCAD software such as Auto lisp. 
</p>
<p>
Recent past CEO of Autodesk Carol Bartz has made the company to be one of the leading CAD software providers. 
She joined Autodesk as she though software would be the future of tech than hardware. <br>
To summarize the above points:   
A non satisfaction of users (professionals of the built environment) or a decline in progress of a CAD company  
such as Autodesk can partly be seen as the fact that leaders of the CAD industry are in short of understanding of 
the CAD industry, the built environment, short of third party developers,  management problem in their company. <br>
A close attention to the built environment can be important in the cad industry, like Mike Riddle did at the 
Frank Lloyd Wright's foundation that helped start the industry in the first place as far as Autodesk is concerned

               2.2. Brief Insight on Application of Different Scale Projects in AutoCAD 
</h2>
<p>
AutoCAD remains being one of the CAD software that can support any scale of projects: architectural connection 
detail to urban planning level.<br>
Other software such as AutoCAD architecture and Revit serve at building level, GIS at large scale spatial study, etc. 
The standard AutoCAD software serves several fields and scales of projects. <br>  
As professionals of the built environment research across professional boundaries, AutoCAD with the extra required 
preparation and careful need for documentation and management can allow them to think across these boundaries during 
their project implementations and its management.

<h2>
2.3. Background on AutoCAD software features among different releases  
</h2>

<p>The development of products in companies such as Autodesk does come with the territory of research, users’ 
(Built environment professionals) inputs, and technological breakthroughs. <br>
Therefore the brief study of the features and enhancements of the different versions of AutoCAD can help students 
find patterns that can help them understand the practices of the built environment and the CAD industry over the 
years starting from the early 1980s.<br>
Most importantly this is an opportunity to start studying the different commands and functions in AutoCAD by scanning 
through the next four illustrations provided containing an extraction and modification from JAVA T POINT: 
<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/versions-of-autocad" target=none>JAVA T POINT</a>.  Students may visit the site for further information about the topic. <br>
Students should also study short keys of AutoCAD for their computation.  </p>
