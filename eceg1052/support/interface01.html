11. This is the command line. Here you can interact with the software through typing commands in short keys or full 
words in order to create, modify, extract data from, plot, etc. your projects. While most users apply the use of the 
command line in combination with browsing to commands that are visually placed in the menus, ribbons and panels mentioned 
above, almost every user you would know applies the command line while working on their projects.

You will need to right click on your model space and select it and it will appear as a floating tool. If you would

18. This is one of the most important component of your interface. The control panel.  Here you can (a) toggle 
from model space to paper space (to layout) and in layout to model through view ports,  (b) change the grid setting 
of your model space, (c) orthogonal, (d) polar, (e) snaps, (f) annotation and (g) annotative settings, (h) scale of 
drawing in a specific view (h) workspace switching, (h) clearing screen,  (I) isolate objects and (j) customization of 
the control panel it self. Functions such as Ortho, polar, snap, etc. are very important for precision  while creating and modifying 
projects, as such you will usually find your self working with this interface component.
