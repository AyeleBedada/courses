<h2> 1.1.  Objective of the Course.</h2>


<p>The course is intended for second year urban planning students that are beginner users of the AutoCAD software. 
The course is planned to equip students with the AutoCAD software application and other selected, relevant and related 
software for their practice while their study as urban planners and as professionals they would become. At the end of the course 
students should be able to use the AutoCAD software to implement projects with I their professional study areas.Students should be 
able to prepare documents for the built environment by making use of AutoCAD and furthermore students should be able to identify and 
prepare urban planning documents and urban code documents.</p> 

<p>
Students will learn collaborative work processes and how to keep standard of CAD documentation with in both 
individual and group work processes. 
</p> 


<p>
Students are also introduced about the CAD industry in relation to the built environment industry 
so they would look in to further possibilities of CAD applications.   
</p> 
               

<h2> 1.2.  Plan and strategy of the Course. 
</h2>

<p>
Students will participate on (1) Pre-Assessment about their current knowledge of the AutoCAD and on the general 
content of the course. (2) Students will take part on lectures, demonstrations and lab assistance provided to them 
by their instructors. (3) Students will work on class exercises home assignments that are to be done in groups and 
individually. (4) Students will sit on MID and Final Exams. 
</p>


<p>
To strengthen their access to their course in special cases where they cannot attend the in person labs classes, the site 
and handouts presented by instructors are in place for them. 
Assignments should be submitted to the instructors via email or in person. In all cases students should name their email 
subjects and files as instructed by the specific instructor or tutor. In general email subjects and attachment files 
should include Section name_full name of student_exercise or assignment name (example of email subject name or attachment 
file for as student from section A named Abebe Bekele Kebede can be: C_Abebe_Bekele_Kebede_assignment01 ). 
</p>

<h3>Important for final project and assignments: </h3>

<p>
It is intended that students will work in groups and individually at different times, as such final projects 
(are expected to be informative of the entire semesters work are typically sizable for an individual work task) 
are to be done among groups with collaborative work processes of the AutoCAD software. And all other class exercises 
and assignments should be done individually.   
</p>


<h3>Important for class exercises and demonstrations: </h3>


<p> 
Students are to sit for both theoretical and practical tasks.   
</p>

<h3>Brief Background on Urban Planning and Urban Codding: </h3>
<p>
Within the context of the built environment professions, urban planning has a range of large scale to detail concerns. Just like other 
disciplines professionals of urban planning produce drawing documents. It is based on these documents that other disciplines 
such as urban designers and Architecture are placed within the context of intended development plan.  
</p>
<p>
(1) Urban planning (structures of city, policies, infrastructure, neighborhoods, 
building codes and regulations), (2) Urban Design (city features based on plans), (3) 
[ Architecture, Structural Design, road, Electrical Design, Sanitary Design and other infrastructure design] , (4)Landscape design,  environment planning and Interior design. 
The following texts and images can be referenced with the Book <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Urban-Coding-and-Planning/Marshall/p/book/9780415441278" target="_blank">‘urban Codding and Planning’ </a>by Stephen Marshall: Among the most 
important documents that are produced by urban planners are: Urban Planes, urban codes and regulations.  </p>
<p>
Urban coding may be part of a planning or design process but it is, in principle, a distinct means of generating urban order in its own right. Urban Codding is the term urban coding could be used in a general sense to mean the application of any kind of code used in the urban context. 
Planning has historically tended to be extrovert, heroic, visionary, innovative: concerned with the outline or big picture, 
the broad-brush, the clean-sweep. Sometimes planning is seen as the more creative, whereas coding is more constraining: while 
the plan dreams of new grand axes and vistas, the code tells you that you must construct your house of brick or stone.


The following images are popular examples of these documents:

<p>
  Urban planning and codding have evolved both in the concept and documentation. 
  As part of your exercise for this section you will be discussing about this matter in relation to usage of software and work process. 
</p>

Please take a look at similar documents of local projects in ethiopia and  discuss their software application with your instructors and classmates.

You will not be working on preparation of large scale urban planning, regulations and codes on this course. However your understanding about these projects 
wil allow you have an understanding about the strategy you should have to work on the courses small exercises and your future software usage 
during your urban planning study and as professional.
