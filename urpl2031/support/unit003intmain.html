<h3>Study about the 18 indicated interface components of AutoCAD on the following image and related link. </h3>
You will find this interface once you opened a new project or an exiting project in AutoCAD.  There are generally 18 
important components of the interface you want to study. They are described in the next slides. 
You can also find these descriptions on the provided power point presentation <br><br>

<h3>The above numbered interface components are listed here briefly for your quick reference:</h3> 

<p>
1: Autodesk AutoCAD version Title, 2: Quick access toolbars, 3: Application button, 4’: menu bar classic, 4: default tabs of the annotative interface, 
5: The ribbon, 6: Currently opened project Tabs, 7: view ports display setup, 8: the model space, 9: User Coordinate System (UCS), 
10: model space and layout tabs, 11: command line, 12: Online services, 13: Minimize, expand or close AutoCAD window, 
14: display options of the panels, ribbon and tabs, 15: current project window close, minimize and maximize, 16: viewcube, 17: steering wheel , 
18: Control Panel, 0: The mouse cursor or pointer. </p>

<br><br>

<p>At this point it is important to note the fact that in AutoCAD software there are also interface components that are  
               by default floating and  docked panels or can be made floating and docked according to the user’s preference. 
               These components include Properties panel, layer properties manager, etc. You can right click on any object
                you are drawing (creating) or editing and open the properties panel which you can implement as floating 
                (not attached to fixed components of the interface) or docked (attached to fixed interface components) 
                interface component.  This topic will be continue sly mentioned during your exercise activities. 
               </p>

            
<p>
To further discuss about the matter over: <br>
with respect to what comes below the level of the tabs, it is important to understand that below tabs are ribbons  under them are panels containing specialized group 
of commands or tools that are placed horizontally arranged in a ribbon or every tab separated by an engraved line. 
The general level of hierarchy in accessing the commands or tools of AutoCAD are : Tabs + ribbons + panels + commands or tools 
(on recent interfaces). The older versions use the panel and tools bar system. Please take note of the fact that you  can mouse 
hover on any tools of the panels and access general information about each tool. Short key command and further information on how 
and what to use the commands for.    
Right clicking on each of the tools in a panel you will find an options such as (a) Show tabs and (b) show panels and (c). 
These options will allow you to hide or un hide any of the tabs and panels in your interface as per your interest. You can 
also add any of the panels in to the list of the quick access bar discussed above in the interface figures. How ever if you 
would right click in the ribbon with out clicking on the tools you will only find the first two options. Right clicking in the 
tab areas will yield different dropdown list from what you will get in the ribbon.   
Please also take note of the fact that you can get a docked or float windows when you for example right click on a drawing 
element in your model space such a properties manager panel. Or if you would click on the layer tool from its panel instead ,
 you will end up with the layer properties manager floating panel. Block editor windows are also floating windows.  The following 
 texts and images will explore the matter further partly.  </p>

   <h3>Understand that most commands must come together for the user to create a proper project. </h3>  


<p>
Only drawing lines and other objects without using the OSNAP modes ,ORTHOMODE/ POLAR mode applications 
from the control panel  would not yield a drawing that has precision. Similarly if a user applies the above 
modes and does not apply layers properly, would not create a project that is accessible for further modification 
(actually layers should be the first thing users should think about before starting to draw).   
Think that you need to coordinate among for example the draw panel (line, polyline, circle ,arc, polygon, etc. ), 
the modify panel (move, rotate, offset, etc.),  the annotate panel (text, dimension, leader, table, etc.), 
the control panel (ORTHO, POLAR, OSNAP, etc.) and the layer panel (layer properties, on/off, freeze, etc. ) 
should come together for your successful drawing activity. 
   </p> 


   <p>
Therefore, in AutoCAD simply (minimally) put , you organize (layer panel), you set up for precision (control panel), 
you create (draw panel, annotate panel, and the like), you modify (modify panel), you prepare for plot and presentation 
( layout tab) , you save (application icon/button or ctrl+s).

<p>
There are five additional layer properties in the layout space that are specific to viewports and are not included while you 
are in the model space. <br>  
(to access the layer properties service: (1) type Layer in the command line, (2) home tab + layers panel + layer properties))
</p>

<p>   The standard AutoCAD software comes with only one or two default layers and the user needs to carefully create needed layers 
      ad create standards for projects. <br> <br>The use of layers guarantees future modification and management of your project. Unless you have carefully created layers from the start, you will be faced with a lot of time cleaning up your document which is not a best practice in AutoCAD.

<h3> Comparison of layer properties in model space and layout space:</h3> 

The layer properties in the model space are as indicated:  12 properties: 1:Status, 2: name, 3: freeze, 4: on/off, 5: lock,  6: plot, 7: color, 
8: linetype, 9: lineweight, 10: transparency,  11: new viewport freeze and 12: descriptions. 
The layer properties in the layout space are as:  17 properties with additional 5 on top of what we have in model space: the additional 5 
layer properties are: 1: Viewport freeze, 2: viewport color, 3: viewport line type, 4: viewport line weight and, 5: viewport transparency. 
The above five layer properties are used to add or modify properties of a layer in a specific view port with out affecting other viewports 
or the project in model space.

      You can publish and plot your project from both the model space and the layout space. 
      To make use of the plot service of the software one needs to understand the difference between the model space and the layout space, 
      since the latter is dedicated for organizing your project for plotting while the former is dedicated to creating and modifying. 
      The following image shows some of the basic differences between the model space and the layout space. 
      The layout space comes with ‘PLOT’ tab that allows to draw viewports of different shapes and paper sizes. In the following slides you 
      can find the comparison of the model space and layout space in picture and table.

      The extent at which you understand the difference between the model space and the layout space allows you to better understand 
      the plot service of the software. You can access the page setup manager by right clicking on one of the tabs in the layout window or by 
      typing in the command PAGESETUP in the layout window. As shown on the images left to right.

      <br>

<p>On this section yuo will find four reading assignments. The reading assignments are prepared with the intention that you will expand your 
      theoretical study of the AutoCAD software interface.  
In all the four reading assignments students are expected to prepare a short paragraph as per the description of the task on the slides.  
By taking in to consideration the fact that the study so far is about theoretical study of the AutoCAD software, the scope of the reading 
assignments is set to be that studnts only focus on what and where questions and should not address how questions that are related o process 
that would require practical study of the software. </p>
<br><br>
<h3>Reading assignment 1 (View tab/Pallets Panel): </h3> <br>
Students should explore the indicated interface component and its sub components (view tab + pallets panel + …) and compose a short paragraph about 
where these components are found in AutoCAD, what type of commands they contain and what they are used for.    
<br>

<h3>Reading assignment 2 (block Editor):  </h3> <br>
Students should explore the indicated interface components (home tab + edit block  definition + block editor window )  
and compose a short paragraph about where these components are found in AutoCAD, what type of commands they contain and what 
they are used for.

      In this section of the course we have covered the study of AutoCAD interface in theory with illustrations, comparisons and discussions, however we 
      have to still work on Demonstration and practical exercise (small and basic) covering most interface theory discussion. While with in this section the above   
      two points should be covered.
